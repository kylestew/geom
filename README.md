# GEOM

## A geometry data and functions library inspired by [thi.ng/geom](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/geom)

GEOM is split into multiple sub-packages

+ `geom.data` - a collection of data forward geometry shapes (rectangle, circle, polygon)
+ `geom.ops` - functions that take data (from geom.shapes) and perform geometric related algorithms on them (i.e. resample, find bounds, etc)
