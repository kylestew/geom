# GEOM

## A geometry data and functions library inspired by [thi.ng/geom](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/geom)

GEOM is split into multiple sub-packages

### DAT: `geom.data`

> A collection of data forward geometry shapes (rectangle, circle, polygon)

### OPS: `geom.ops`

> Functions that take data (from `geom.data`) and perform geometric related algorithms on them (i.e. resample, find bounds, etc)

### MATH: `geom.math`

> Mathmatical helper functions


## Testing

Using `pytest`

    $ pytest
